# üöÄ Cruiser
OGame assistant that keeps your galactic empire safe, notifies you about any potential threats and automates tedious tasks.

# Features
*OGame Version Compatibility*: **7.3.0**

* üõ°Ô∏è **Smart fleet saving**: Cruiser watches over your account making sure that all your planets (and moons) are protected. Your fleets and resources will be saved in a way that prevents them from being sniped with sensor phalanx and requires minimum fuel consumption.

* üîî **Notifications**: Cruiser notifies you about any hostile events and the actions it takes to protect you.

* üåå **Auto expeditions**: Cruiser manages expeditions for you so that you will never again need to worry about having free expedition slots.

# How to use?

If you like what you see but you're not sure how to use it, don't worry - it's simple! Here I'll show you how to run a minimalistic setup for a maximal gain. If you're looking to install Cruiser first, go to [Installation](#installation). 

Now, let's take a look at the configuration file [config.yaml](config.yaml). There, we can configure Cruiser to behave exactly how we want it to. You can overwrite the original file, but I suggest you create a copy and work from there. In this section I'll show you how to create a configuration from scratch. The entire configuration example is available at the end of this section.

#### Minimal Setup

Cruiser only requires you to provide your account information in order to monitor your account and defend it from any attacks. We need to provide all the essential information for Cruiser to not only log in to the account but also to find the server in which it's supposed to play. Let's start with the server. We can either give the name of the server (e.g. `Universe 1`) or the server number (e.g. `1`). Additionally, we need to provide the language of the server in an ISO language code (e.g. `en`) and server country (e.g. `GB`). You can find both the language and the country in the URL of the game lobby (e.g. https://lobby.ogame.gameforge.com/en_GB/). Next, we supply the username which is our email address, and the password:

```yaml
account:
  username: user@example.com
  password: qwerty
  universe: 1
  language: en
  country: GB
```

With this minimal information, Cruiser will be able to log in to the account and watch for any hostile fleets. Should any attack be launched on one of our planets, Cruiser will wait until some time before the attack (which you can adjust), and proceed with the defense: 
 
* Cruiser is aware of any returning and deployment fleets and will try to save them too.
* Cruiser automatically determines the best escape destination and sends the fleet with resources there.
* After the attack, Cruiser can recall the saved fleet (you have to set it in the configuration; see [config.yaml](config.yaml)).

As you can see, you don't have to configure anything - Cruiser is smart enough to defend your planets (and moons) on its own.

#### Notifications

If you would like to know what happens to your account while you're away, you can setup a Telegram bot that will send you important notifications. Below I've included a quick summary on how to setup such bot.

First follow the official tutorial on how to create a Telegram bot: https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot. Once you're finished, you should get a `token` which is required to authorize your Telegram bot. Next, send a dummy message to your Telegram bot. That will start a chat which Cruiser will use to communicate with you. Finally you can find the `chat_id` by following this link: `https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/getUpdates` where `<token>` is the string token you've received in the first step.

Once you have the `token` and `chat_id` you can add Telegram notifications to the configuration file:

```yaml
listeners:
  telegram:
    api_token: <token>
    chat_id: <chat_id>
  discord:
    webhook_url: <webhook_url>
bot:
  listeners: [telegram]
```

In the configuration above we define a new listener called `telegram` with two arguments required to enable messaging: `api_token` and `chat_id`. Then we add `telegram` to the list of listeners in the bot configuration. That's it! 

#### Expeditions

Currently, the meta is to run as many expeditions as humanly possible. Thank god Cruiser is not a human and so it can run more expeditions. 

Let's image that we've just started playing in a new server and want to setup a small expedition fleet and have Cruiser resend it as soon as it returns to our home planet at `[1, 115, 8]`. We'll call this expedition `neverending` and assign 5 small cargo ships to it:

```yaml
expeditions:
  neverending:
    origin: [1, 115, 8]
    ships:
      small_cargo: 5
bot:
  expeditions: [neverending]
```

As you can see, you only need to provide the origin and the fleet in order to setup a simple expedition that runs forever. Once defined, you can add expeditions to the list in the bot configuration. Cruiser will happily manage your expeditions so that you won't have to do anything. Additionally, Cruiser watches over the galaxy in case your expeditions create debris and sends pathfinders to harvest it. Currently, expedition debris in the galaxy view can only be seen by the discoverer class. Therefore, Cruiser can automatically harvest expedition debris only if you're a discoverer.

Below is a list of all names of the ships that you can send on an expedition:

```
small_cargo
large_cargo
light_fighter
heavy_fighter
cruiser
battleship
colony_ship
recycler
espionage_probe
bomber
destroyer
deathstar
battlecruiser
reaper
pathfinder
```

Finally, take a look at the template configuration located in the configuration file [config.yaml](config.yaml) with all possible expeditions settings.


#### Complete Configuration

If you've followed all of the steps above, the entire configuration file should look like this:

```yaml
account:
  username: user@example.com
  password: qwerty
  universe: 1
  language: en
  country: GB

listeners:
  telegram:
    api_token: <token>
    chat_id: <chat_id>

expeditions:
  neverending:
    origin: [1, 115, 8]
    ships:
      small_cargo: 5

bot:
  listeners: [telegram]
  expeditions: [neverending]
```

Don't be afraid to change the configuration whenever you want. Cruiser automatically adjusts to the current state of your account. Therefore it can be restarted at any time without causing any problems. Furthermore, you are free to login from the browser or mobile whenever you want - Cruiser won't mind.

Don't forget to read the template configuration located in the configuration file [config.yaml](config.yaml). There you will find all possible settings.

If you would like to see a feature that is currently missing, don't hesitate to make a suggestion. Have fun! :)

# Installation
1. Install Python `>=3.7.3`
2. Install Python packages `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Setup account information in `config.yaml`
4. Start Cruiser `python start_bot.py`
    * Alternatively: `python start_bot.py --config <path-to-config>` if you're using a different configuration file than [config.yaml](config.yaml).

# üêã Docker

For those of you who like to run containers I've included an easy setup to run on a Debian:
1. Build docker image `docker-build.sh`
2. Run docker container `docker-run.sh [--config <path-to-config>]`

Executing the shell script `docker-run.sh` will start the container in a detached mode which means that it runs in the background of your terminal. You can run `docker attach` to connect to your container. Furthermore, the container is managed by a restart policy that makes sure that the container will be restarted in case it suddenly stops running. Finally, you can run `docker stop` to stop the container.

# Contribution
Any contributions are very welcome! Make sure to first post an issue with the features you want to implement and try to stick to the coding style of the project. Happy coding!
